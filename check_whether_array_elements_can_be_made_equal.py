# Given an array a, write a function to feed in the array elements and check whether they can all be made equal by only multiplying the numbers by 2 or 7. (you can multiply by these #s as many times as you like)
# If all elements can be made equal, return False, otherwise return True.
# Example:
# Input
# a = [128, 4, 2]
# Here, we can turn all elements into 128, by multiplying by 2
# 128, 4*2*2*2*2*2 = 128, 2*2*2*2*2*2*2 = 128
# Output:
# True
# Input
# a = [65, 4, 2]
# Here, we cannot make all elements equal through multiplication by 2 or 7, 
# so we return false
# Output:
# False
